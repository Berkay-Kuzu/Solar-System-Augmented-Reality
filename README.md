# Solar-System-Augmented-Reality
This is a solar system model built with Augmented Reality. When the users run the app, they can see the sun, the moon, the mars, and the earth in their room respectively. This model is pretty educational for the children so that they can make a comparison between different planets.

Note: The users need to have a physical iOS device such as iPad and iPhone in order to run this app because the simulator do not have the camera function.
